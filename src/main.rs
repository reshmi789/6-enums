/*
Advantages - 
- enum is more concise
- the name of each enum variant that we define also becomes a 
function that constructs an instance of the enum.
- each variant can have different types and amounts of associated data. 
Ex - If we wanted to store V4 addresses as four u8 values but still express V6 addresses as one String value, we wouldnâ€™t be able to with a struct. Enums handle this case with ease
