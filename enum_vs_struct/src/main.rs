/*
Advantages - 
- enum is more concise
- the name of each enum variant that we define also becomes a 
function that constructs an instance of the enum.
- each variant can have different types and amounts of associated data. 
-  can put any kind of data inside an enum variant: strings, numeric types, structs, enums
